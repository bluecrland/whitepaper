## Motivation & Mission Statement

Everything acts as some kind of prop or craft (propcraft). Propcrafts exist forever in NFT(Non-Fungible Token). Our mission is to construct a DAO community dedicated to NFTs of props and crafts crossing beyond horizons of multiple games, applications and industries.

Current market still lacks of excellent NFT standards which support propcrafts to seamlessly traverse/trek through different applicaitons, games or virtual horizons, such as game items, characters/avatars, props and AI crafts.

Propcraft project is trying to create and establish such NFT token standards and implement them on top of solana blockchain technology.
