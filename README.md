## Inception and Motivation

Everything acts as some kind of prop or craft (propcraft). Propcrafts exist forever in NFT(Non-Fungible Token). 

Current market still lacks of excellent NFT standards which support propcrafts to seamlessly traverse/trek through different applicaitons, games or virtual horizons, such as game items, characters/avatars, props and AI crafts.

Propcraft project is trying to create and establish such NFT token standards and implement them on top of solana blockchain technology.

## Mission Statements

Construct a DAO community dedicated to NFTs of props and crafts crossing beyond horizons of multiple games, applications and industries.

Develop and advance ecosystem of propcrafts, from propcrafts NFT minting, presentation, air drop, earn, exchange, transaction as well as circulation.

Enable propcrafts flexible to have their own abilities, components as well as attributes. Components themselves may also be NFTs, and can be mounted/unmounted to/from other propcrafts, becoming a part or sub component of others. 

Support evolutive propcrafts. The abilities, attributes or components of propcrafts can change as time goes by, that is, propcrafts tend to evolve over time. 

Construct general props and crafts protocol, design proof of evolution(PoE) by which all community members will be rewarded and recognized with PRO tokens or some kinds of NFT. The common approaches to obtain tokens and NFTs include air drop as well as multiple social interactions like sign up, sign in, check in, post, comment, forward, etc. Meanwhile, Play-to-Earn is another important way to obtain and evolve propcraftsâ€™ performance.

Customize and build web3.0 oriented propcrafts blockchain, provide propcrafts-friendly token(FT + NFT) lifecycle management, covering mint, mount/unmount, transfer, move, change, activate/deactivate, burn, etc.
